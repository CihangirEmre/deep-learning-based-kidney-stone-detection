# Deep Learning-Based Kidney Stone Detection

This repository contains the graduation project proposal and ongoing development files for a deep learning-based kidney stone detection system.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop an artificial intelligence model capable of detecting kidney stones in medical CT images using deep learning-based object detection techniques.

The system aims to support medical diagnosis by automatically identifying kidney stones and marking their locations in CT scan images.

## Motivation

Kidney stone diagnosis through manual analysis of CT images can be time-consuming and subject to human error. By leveraging deep learning-based object detection models, this project aims to:

- Improve diagnostic efficiency
- Reduce workload of radiologists
- Provide consistent and objective detection results

## Methodology (Planned)

The project will include:

- Medical image dataset preprocessing
- Data augmentation techniques
- Object detection model training (Transformer-based architecture such as RT-DETR)
- Model evaluation using:
  - mAP (mean Average Precision)
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
- Development of a desktop interface for testing predictions

## Current Status

- Project proposal completed
- Literature review ongoing
- Dataset analysis phase in progress
- Model experimentation planned
